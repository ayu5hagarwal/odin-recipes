    <h1>Banana Shake</h1>
    <img src="../images/banana-shake.jpeg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Traditional Indian milkshakes are cold and creamy drinks that are made in a variety of tasty flavors. </p>
        <p>I love all sorts of milkshakes, from decadent Chocolate Shake to fresh and fruity Strawberry Milkshake </p>
       <p> por Mango Milkshake just about any favorite ingredient can be turned into a shake! </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 Banana</li>
        <li>250ml Coconut Milk</li>
        <li>2 drops Vanilla Extract</li>
        <li>Raw sugar(acc. to taste)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>First peel and chop 3 medium sized bananas, roughly 2 cups. Add the chopped bananas in a mixer or blender jar.</li>
        <li>Then add 2 cups of lite coconut milk or thin coconut milk, preferably cold or chilled. I have used Homemade <br>
            Coconut Milk with a very thin consistency. </li>
        <li> Add a Â½ teaspoon of vanilla extract, or 1 to 2 pinches of vanilla powder is optional, but the vanilla <br>
            really does help to balance the sweetness of the banana and adds great flavor.</li>
        <li>Add 2 to 3 tablespoons, or more or less to taste, of raw sugar or jaggery. </li>
        <li>Blend until smooth. If you find the banana shake to be very thick, add a few splashes<br>
             of water and blend again until you get the desired consistency.</li>
        <li>Pour into 2 large or 3 small glasses. </li>
    </ol>
