    <h1>Chicken Biryani</h1>
    <img src="../images/biryani.jpg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken Biryani is a savory chicken and rice dish that includes layers of chicken, rice, and aromatics that are steamed together.<br>
        The bottom layer of rice absorbs all the chicken juices as it cooks, giving it a tender texture and rich flavor, while the top layer<br>
         of rice turns out white and fluffy. Buried in the Biryani, you'll find whole cuts of succulent chicken bursting with flavor from the <br>
        potent array of spices, herbs, and aromatics it's marinated in.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken </li>
        <li>Aromatics</li>
        <li>Herbs</li>
        <li>Spices</li>
        <li>Onions</li>
        <li>Ghee</li>
        <li>Chilli Peppers</li>
        <li>Rice</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To marinate the chicken for the biryani, combine the vegetable oil, garlic, ginger, chili peppers, mint, cilantro, garam masala,<br>
             cinnamon and salt in a large bowl and stir together. Add the chicken pieces and toss together making sure the chicken is thoroughly <br>
             coated in the marinade. Allow the chicken to marinate for at least 1 hour or up to overnight.</li>
        <li>In a pot wide enough to hold the chicken in a single layer, add the ghee and onions and saute the<br>
             onions until they are well caramelized (15-20 minutes). Transfer the caramelized onions to a bowl and set aside.</li>
        <li>While the onions caramelize, prepare the rice by washing in a strainer under cold running water until the water runs clear.</li>
        <li>To par-boil the rice, add the water, salt, cardamom, cumin and bay leaf to a pot and bring to a boil. Add the rice and boil for 7 <br>
            minutes. Drain the rice, reserving 1 cup of the liquid.</li>
        <li>In the pot you caramelized the onions in, add the chicken in a single layer, skin-side down. Fry until golden brown on one side <br>
            (about 5 minutes). Flip the chicken over and fry the other side until golden brown. Transfer the chicken back to the bowl you marinated it in.</li>
        <li>To assemble the biryani, add the saffron to the rice and toss to distribute evenly. Add half the rice mixture to the bottom of the pot you <br>
            browned the chicken in.</li>
        <li>Top the rice with the chicken in a single layer.</li>
        <li>Top the chicken with an even layer of caramelized onions.</li>
        <li>Finish putting together the Biryani by adding the rest of the rice in an even layer. Add 1 cup of reserved liquid from boiling the rice.<br>
             Cover the pot with a lid and put the pot on the stove over medium heat and set the timer for 20 minutes. When you can see steam escaping <br>
             from under the lid, turn down the heat to low and continue cooking until the timer goes off and then turn off the heat.</li>
        <li>Without opening the lid, set the timer for another 10 minutes to steam the biryani.</li>
        <li>    Mix the Chicken Biryani together and then transfer to a serving platter. Garnish with fresh cilantro and serve.</li>
    </ol>
